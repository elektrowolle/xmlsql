xmlsql
======

A library to make sqlite databases from xml files


Please notice: This is/was a sub-project of [PPaper](https://github.com/Rarzarol/PaPEr/). It's not yet ready to apply to your projects. So better don't try.

It was made to work on Android. I think it's a pity and I'd love to change that fact.

xmlsql is not tidy, not stable and not documantated. There is one exception. Here is a google hangout in german I did: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQg5WlvTd_I
It's weird and you better don't watch it. 90 minutes weird gibberish straight.
